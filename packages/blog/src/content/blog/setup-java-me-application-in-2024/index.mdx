title: "Setup Java ME Application in 2024"

Before iPhone and Android, Java ME[^jme] is the de facto to write mobile application on phone, such as Nokia and Ericsson. Most phone on that era was built-in with Java ME CLDC MIDP, allow us to run Java application and most of them is game.

    }

    subgraph cluster_kvm {

      "CLDC" -- "MIDP"
    }
  }
}
```

This post is about to setup Java ME CLDC MIDP on Linux and Windows.

## Requirements

Some requirements that need to run this old technology on current year.

### Linux

Install 32-bit library, here packages name on Arch Linux, so try to search equivalent on specific distro:

```bash
sudo pacman -S lib32-gcc-libs lib32-libxtst lib32-libxext lib32-libxt lib32-libxrender
```

### Windows

Nothing, You good to go.

## Java SDK 1.8

Download and install **Java SE Development Kit 8u202** x86: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html.

## Sun Java Wireless Toolkit 2.5.2

**WTK2.5.2** is build tools, utilities, and a device emulator that only support Linux but you can also run it on Windows. Since Java ME 3 has no support for Linux and Java ME 8 has no CLDC and MIDP.

Download and install: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-archive-downloads-javame-downloads.html.

## NetBeans 8.2

**NetBeans 8.2** IDE is the last version ship with **Mobility** plugin.

Download and install: https://web.archive.org/web/20170428223910/https://netbeans.org/downloads/.

### Mobility Plugin

Install mobility plugin: `Tools > Plugins > Available Plugins`. Check all plugins within Java ME category and install.

### Java Platforms

Integrate WTK2.5.2 to NetBeans: `Tools > Java Platforms`, select Java ME CLDC Platform Emulator, choose WTK2.5.2 directory, next and finish.

Now you can create new project `Java Me > Mobile Application` and select CLDC and MIDP.

## Demo

Some snake game I write[^snake].

## Notes

-   **WTK2.5.2** emulator has bug loading localization and time zone causing emulator got stuck.
-   The best way is to use VM Windows or Wine and install **JDK 1.6** x86 and **NetBeans 7.1.1** (Java ME already included).
