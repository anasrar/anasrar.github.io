## Why ?

When you are using a Go module and encounter a bug, you may try to fix it by forking the repository and sending a pull request. However, the merge or release tag might not be immediately available, and you still need to use the module.

Here is how you can use the **forked module**: After forking the repository and committing the bug fix, you can run the following command:

```bash
go mod edit -replace github.com/someuser/repo=github.com/yourusername/repo@branch
```

This command will add the following code to your `go.mod` file:

```gomod
replace github.com/someuser/repo => github.com/yourusername/repo branch
```

Now, you just need to run the following command to download the module:

```bash
go mod download
```

If you take a look at your `go.mod` file, you will see that the branch has been changed to `tag-(time commit)-(hash commit)`.

```gomod
replace github.com/someuser/repo => github.com/yourusername/repo v0.0.0-(time commit)-(hash commit)
```

Whenever the pull request has been merged, you can feel free to remove the `replace` statement in the `go.mod` file and update the module.
