Not like the update is bad, but after the update there was some app (AppCloud) that run on Secure Folder[^1] that recommend user to installing their recommended apps.

So I just need to uncheck all the apps and finish, **wrong**!. If you do that the first three apps on top row will be install on background, take a look on gray color that said: "Click on the app icon to know more or unselect".

That is bad UI/UX, like who the hell design that (probably product manager forced by inverstor). And kill the purpose of Secure Folder where it only selected app that user manually add and feel secure.

So I just unselect all apps and finish it.
