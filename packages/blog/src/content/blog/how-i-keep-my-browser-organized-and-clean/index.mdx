## TL;DR

Use custom user data directory for `chromium` based browser or profile for `firefox`, simple script to launch it, and don't forget to close unused tab.

## User Data Directory

> **Chromium**
>
> The user data directory contains profile data such as history, bookmarks, and cookies, as well as other per-installation local state[^1].

> **Firefox**
>
> What information is stored in my profile? Bookmarks, Downloads, Browsing History, Passwords, Cookies, Extensions, et cetera[^2].

### Custom User Data Directory

Using custom user data directory allow me to focus and separate my workflow like for personal where all email and social media related, work where I use for work related, and development where I do webdev stuff.

To use custom user data directly, first you need to create new directory, and start browser with user data directory to new directory path.

```bash
chromium-browser --user-data-dir=./dir
firefox --new-instance --profile ./dir
```

To differentiate each browser I use different themes or colors.

#### Pros

-   At least prevent cookie stealer[^3].
-   Manage extension, **no extension** allowed for personal and work.

#### Cons

-   Can not copy user data directly to other machine, use sync, export, and import feature (so far I just tested with chrome, feel free to correct me).
-   Each user data start around ~200MB and grow as cache being stored, but it was worth it.

## Shell Script

You can create custom shortcut, but I use simple shell script with [fzf](//github.com/junegunn/fzf) to launch browser with custom argument.

```bash showLineNumbers
#!/usr/bin/sh

RESULT=$(fzf --delimiter " " --with-nth 1 -- "$@" < <(
  echo "Firefox:Development firefox --new-instance --start-debugger-server 6222 --profile \"$HOME/secret/path/ff/development/\""
  echo "Chrome:Development google-chrome-stable --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=\"$HOME/secret/path/c/development/\""
  echo "Chrome:Personal google-chrome-stable --user-data-dir=\"$HOME/secret/path/c/personal/\""
  echo "Chrome:Work google-chrome-stable --user-data-dir=\"$HOME/secret/path/c/work/\""
))

if [ "$RESULT" != "" ]; then
  COMMAND=$(echo $RESULT | sed 's/[^ ]* //')
  eval $COMMAND &>/dev/null &
fi
```
