Game that I made for js13kGames 2021, got 76th place.

## Information

### Theme

Theme for js13kGames 2021 is **Space**, so I just want to make game about spaceship, the idea is to control spaceship to portal while avoid red line and managing fuel.

### Stack

#### Kontra.js

I choose [Kontra.js](//straker.github.io/kontra/) because it was pretty small and has math vector and collision utilities, the game it self just using vector projection for collision, hierarchy/tree object for rendering, and control input.

#### ZzFX

[ZzFX](//github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX), tiny and powerful, providing so many parameter to generate sound.

#### Parcel

Already using [Parcel](//github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) for many previous project because it fast, but for now on I will recommend and using [Vite](//github.com/vitejs/vite) because it fast and has large ecosystem plugin, so I can easly make plugin to make workflow easier.

### Game Design

#### Control

Giving player challenge to be careful to not crash and also using the planet orbit to move without fuel.

#### Level

The purpose level 1-3 is to make player adapt, but when it comes to 4-6 I was lack of motivation and instead just make hard level, someone notice and write it on js13kGames feedback (LOL).
