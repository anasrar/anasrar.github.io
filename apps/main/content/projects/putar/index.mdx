Simple web app to play 360° video/image.

## Information

### Background

Back then Facebook has support for 360 image and you can view it direcly, because of that I really like render 360 image (mostly just meme) from Blender and upload it on Facebook, and then YouTube also support 360 video, but I don't like to upload just to view 360 video/image, 360 viewer aplication was limited out there.
